class ComparisonNormalizer(FeatureTransformer):
    """
    A transformer for normalizing values within a feature pipeline using a comparison column.
    This is useful for normalizing values against a base column, for example technical analysis indicators
    such as moving averages or bollinger bands against the close price. Can also be used with open, high, low, close.
    This normalizer converts by default to a scale of [0,1]. A value equal to the comparison column will receive a value of 0.5.
    Value above the comparison column will be in the range 0.5-1 and values below will be in the range 0-0.5.
    Items which are more than 100% of the comparison column will be clipped to 1 and items which are of opposite sign (negative) will be clipped to 0.
